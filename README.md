# 22/23 Fundamentals of Data Analysis ATU - David Higgins

This repository will contain my assessment work for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module at the Atlantic Technological University. This module forms part of the Higher Diploma in Computing (Data Analytics) and was undertaken during the 2022/2023 academic year.

The repository will contain five practical Jupyter notebooks focused around the exercises on each of the following five topics:

* Information
* Randomness
* Bias
* Outliers
* Cleansing

A sixth, more comphrensive Jupyter notebook will contain work on theoretical aspects of the Normal Distribution.
