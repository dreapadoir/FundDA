    "The Dunning Kruger effect is a form of cognitive bias that occurs when people with low ability, expertise, or experience regarding a certain type of task or area of knowledge tend to overestimate their ability or knowledge (Wikipedia, 2022). Motta, Callaghan and Sylvester (2018) studied the effect it had on anti vaccine policy attitudes among the public. They found that one third of the group studied believed themselves to as knowledgable or more knowledgable than doctors or scientists about the causes of vaccines. This overconfidence in their expertise was highest among people with the low levels of knowledge about autism and who were more likely to endorse misinformation about the subject. This also appeared to correlate with opposition to vaccines. The issue surrounding vaccines and the Dunning Kruger effect contribution to vaccine opposition became very apparent throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. The ability to spread misinformation rapidly through social media amplified the effect and led to a widely supported opposition movement. Anti vaccine activists misinterpreted results of genuine medical trials, seized on dubious and discredited research studies and accepted as fact deliberate information. With this knowledge and the endorsement of likeminded people, they believed that they knew more than medical and public health officials and were in a better position to advise people on the safety or otherwise of vaccines."

    "A common example of cognitive bias is loss aversion or status quo bias. This occurs when a preference to avoid risk or loss is the deciding factor in a decision, even if it is not the best outcome. An example of this was given by Hartley, Lanot, & Walker (2013) in their research on the gameshow \"Who wants to be a Millionaire?\". Contestants were presented with a choice of two outcomes of equal probability. If they got it wrong, they would lose \\\\$99999. If they got it right, they would gain \\\\$400000. They had the option to not answer the question and leave with their present winnings of \\\\$100000. Contestants were more likely to leave with the money they already had rather than risk losing \\$99999. This is despite the fact that attempting the question had a better expected value than taking the winnings and leaving. The expected value is given by\n",

    "The expected value is significantly higher than their present winnings but the aversion to loss prevents most contestants from taking the risk."
